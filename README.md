## [Demo](https://waterrmalann.github.io/ticker/)   |   [Source](https://github.com/waterrmalann/ticker/blob/main/js/script.js)

A clean, simple, and minimal web stopwatch with laps/flags that counts down to the millisecond. Supports pause and play. Laps are neatly recorded in a list view with the time difference between the lap (a live version of which also runs as a separate stopwatch under the main one). This tiny project was written in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
